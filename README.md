# Fiducial Objects üéØ

## Overview
Fiducial Objects are advanced fiducial markers designed for multiplanar space, offering customizable marker sets arranged in fully customizable structures. This design enhances stability and robustness in computing camera pose, improving resistance to distortions. Pose estimation is possible even with partial visibility of the fiducial object„Äê15‚Ä†source„Äë.

## Tutorials
Initial tutorials are available to help users familiarize themselves with the tool.
